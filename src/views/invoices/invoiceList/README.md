# Invoice List - Enhanced Filtering System with Modern UI/UX

## Overview

The invoice list has been completely refactored to eliminate duplication between tab-based status filtering and drawer-based status filtering, while implementing a modern UI/UX that matches the quotation list design.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Unified Filter System
- **Before**: Separate tab handler and filter handler with duplicated status filtering
- **After**: Single unified filter handler that manages both tabs and advanced filters

### 2. Modern UI/UX Design
- **Collapsible Filter Card**: Matches quotation filter design with expandable sections
- **Modern Header**: Avatar, title, and action button layout similar to quotations
- **Chip-based Selection**: Visual status chips for better user experience
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with proper spacing

### 3. Advanced Mode Toggle
- **Simple Mode**: Use status tabs for quick filtering (default behavior)
- **Advanced Mode**: Select multiple statuses independently in the filter card
- **Seamless Switching**: Mode toggle integrated directly in filter header

### 4. Enhanced Visual Feedback
- Filter count indicators on buttons and headers
- Visual feedback when advanced mode is active
- Improved filter card with better organization
- Status chips with color coding in advanced mode
- Contextual help messages

### UI/UX Features

#### Modern Filter Card
```jsx
// Collapsible design with header controls
<Card>
  <Box onClick={handleToggleFilter}>
    <Icon + Title + AdvancedToggle + FilterCount + ChevronIcon>
  </Box>
  <Collapse>
    <FilterFields + StatusChips + ActionButtons>
  </Collapse>
</Card>
```

#### Header Design
```jsx
// Modern header with avatar and action button
<Box flexDirection="row" justifyContent="space-between">
  <Avatar + Title>
  <NewInvoiceButton>
</Box>
```

#### Advanced Status Selection
```jsx
// Quick status chips for advanced mode
<Stack direction="row" flexWrap="wrap">
  {statusOptions.map(option =>
    <Chip clickable variant={selected ? 'filled' : 'outlined'} />
  )}
</Stack>
```

## Key Features

### Simple Mode (Default)
- Status tabs for quick filtering
- Single status selection
- Traditional tab-based navigation
- Tabs remain enabled and functional

### Advanced Mode
- Multi-status selection via dropdown and chips
- Status tabs become disabled with visual feedback
- Quick status selection chips
- Advanced filtering capabilities

### Filter State Management
```javascript
const filterValues = {
  statusTab: 'ALL',           // Current tab (simple mode)
  status: [],                 // Multiple statuses (advanced mode)
  customer: [],               // Customer filters
  invoiceNumber: [],          // Invoice number filters
  fromDate: '',               // Date range start
  toDate: '',                 // Date range end
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Tab Filtering
```jsx
// User clicks on "Paid" tab
// System filters invoices with status = 'PAID'
// Other filters remain active
```

### Advanced Multi-Status Filtering
```jsx
// User enables advanced mode in filter card
// User selects "Paid" and "Partially Paid" via dropdown or chips
// System filters invoices with status IN ['PAID', 'PARTIALLY_PAID']
// Tab filtering becomes disabled with visual feedback
```

### Combined Filtering
```jsx
// User can combine status filters with:
// - Customer selection (multi-select dropdown)
// - Date ranges (date pickers)
// - Invoice number search (multi-select dropdown)
// All filters work together seamlessly
```

## Benefits
